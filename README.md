### Hi, I'm Omar Elrefaei ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent graduate in Nanotechnology Engineering from the University of Waterloo, with a focus on solving complex problems using computational tools. My experience spans macroeconomic modeling, optical testing automation, and Python tool development. I enjoy optimizing code performance and working across multiple languages, including Python, Rust, and Julia.

### Some of my opensource contributions
- https://github.com/oxinabox/DataDeps.jl/pull/165
- https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/SymbolicUtils.jl/pull/468
- https://github.com/JuliaML/TableTransforms.jl/pull/15
- https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/Molly.jl/pull/175



<!--

### ðŸ”§ A few of my humble contributions:
- **Bank of Canada**: Contributed to rearchitecting a macroeconomic modeling tool, adding higher-order approximations and performance optimizations in Julia.
- **Lumentum**: Spearheaded the development of a data processing tool for optical component QA, reducing processing time by 80%.


### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- Advanced Rust and CUDA for performance optimization.
- Deepening my expertise in molecular dynamics and density functional theory.
